## Parameters
- **RequesterUPN**: The User Principal Name (UPN) of the requester initiating the MFA reset.
- **UserUPN**: The UPN of the user whose MFA is to be reset.

## Expected Outputs
- A success message indicating that the MFA has been reset for the specified user.
- An error message if the requester lacks the necessary permissions or if the operation fails for any reason.

## Potential Failure Reasons
- The requester is not a member of a group with permission to reset MFA.
- The specified user does not exist or is invalid.
- An error occurs during the MFA reset process.

## Logging
The script logs all actions taken, including successful resets and any errors encountered, to facilitate troubleshooting and auditing.

## Usage

```powershell
.\Reset-MFA.ps1 -RequesterUPN "requester@example.com" -UserUPN "user@example.com"
```

Ensure to check the logs for any issues if the script does not execute as expected.
